## Cool Stuff I've Worked On

<details open>
  <summary><b>Déjà Vu</b> (2020)</summary>
<br>
I was the sole programmer for Déjà Vu, an indie puzzle game about clones.  I also contributed to puzzle and level design, story, music, and handled the Xbox and Steam porting. The game features many accessiblity features like colorblind mode and dark mode for photosensitive players. It has been localized in 13 different languages. Déjà Vu has a 4.7/5 star rating on Xbox as of 10/16/2021.

  <summary><b>Contacts Quest</b> (2016)</summary>
<br>
  
An FPS made in Unity3D for a 24 hour hackathon at work.  I used my [existing retro FPS project](https://github.com/EricFreeman/DungeonGame) as the base.  Contacts Quest was a 1-800 Contacts themed FPS in the vein of classic company branded shooters like Chex Quest.  You use bottles of contact solution to shoot at enemies with irritated eyes to calm them down.
