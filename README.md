# Hi there, I'm [Eric Freeman](http://eric.bz/) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer located in Utah with a passion for creating video games and writing music.

## Cool Stuff I've Worked On

#### DÃ©jÃ  Vu
I was the sole programmer for DÃ©jÃ  Vu, an indie puzzle game about clones.  I also contributed to puzzle and level design, story, music, and handled the Xbox and Steam porting.

#### Contacts Quest
An FPS made in Unity3D for a 24 hour hackathon at work.  I used my [existing retro FPS project](https://github.com/EricFreeman/DungeonGame) as the base.  Contacts Quest was a 1-800 Contacts themed FPS in the vein of classic company branded shooters like Chex Quest.  You use bottles of contact solution to shoot at enemies with irritated eyes to calm them down.
